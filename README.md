IM3D
======

A Monte Carlo (MC) code for the simulation of primary radiation damage 
in arbitrarily complex objects, including nanostructures, under ion 
irradiation.

Intended to go beyond the limitations of SRIM, open as much source code 
as possible, and parallelize effectively on modern computers.

libstruct_m.a is a pre-compiled library of geometric functions, used in 
im3d, and is the only part of the code which is not open-source. It is 
copyright protected under Chinese law by the Chinese Academy of 
Sciences. All other parts are open-source under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC
