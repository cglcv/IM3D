  Different "materials" can be defined. A material can be single-elemental
  as well as a compound.
  The target consists of (possibly a large number of) little cells. Each of
  these is filled with one of the defined materials.
  Alternatively, for the dynamic version, a number of separate elements are
  defined. Each cell has a composition vector describing the fractions of
  each element in that cell. This is called element-based in contrast to
  "material-based".

/*--------------------------Global variables-------------------------*/
/*======================================================================
  The target is a cuboid-shaped box, which consists of (possibly a large number
  of) of small equal-sized cuboid cells. Several arrays describe the target
  composition, the distributions of implanted ions, recoils, vacancies and so
  on. The dimension of the target is defined by the number and size of the
  small cells in each direction.
  Furthermore, boundary conditions need to be defined in each target direction.
  x is the primary incident ion beam direction. (Though the ion beam may hit
  the target under any angle).
  Note, that integer coordinates always refer to a cell x, y and z number,
  while float coordinates always to refer to nm positions in the target.

  ygli:
  With a half-infinite substrate in the target will make the target more
  realistic and the program more efficient.
  Only the complex structures will be constructed by different geometry
  methods, the other parts can be described by a uniform region with the
  same composition.
  The complex structures can be defined in a special region in term of
  (x0, x0+dx), (y0, y0+dy) and (z0, z0+dz). if substrate = 1, the tracing ion
  is in the substrate region, otherwise it is in a special region.
  z=0 is at the surface of substrate region.
  So, it is convenient for the case of only one special region included(Materials+1).
  For the case of many special structures included in the CSG method, still
  only one special region is included, for the regions without CSG structures
  are also defined as substrate.
  Statistic in substrate region can be counted with a increasing non-uniform mesh.
  Different ions and defects can be saved as their exact coordinates.
