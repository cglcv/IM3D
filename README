IM3D is a 3d Monte Carlo simulation code designed to run efficiently
on parallel computers. It can rapidly simulate the transport of ions
and subsequent radiation damages in arbitrary complex 3D nanostructured
materials. It is an open-source code, distributed freely under the
terms of the GNU Public License (GPL).

IM3D was sponsored by Prof. Ju Li and Prof. Zhi Zeng, and mainly 
developed by Dr. Yonggang Li during his visit to MIT in 2014. The 
support of CSG/FETM geometric algorithms from Prof. Zejun Ding as well 
as useful contributions and discussions from Prof. Michael Short and 
Prof. Yang Yang are very much appreciated. Please visit the webiite at 
https://github.com/shortlab/IM3D for more information about the code and 
its uses.
